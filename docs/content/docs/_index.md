🚀 **Welcome to CRADLE!**

Your all-in-one **collaborative threat intelligence** platform is here! This guide will help you set up, explore, and maximize CRADLE for seamless cyber threat investigations.

## 🔍 What is CRADLE?

CRADLE is a powerful tool built for **Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI)** analysts. It combines collaborative note-taking, automated data linking, and dynamic visualizations—so you can **capture, analyze, and share** threat intelligence with ease. Whether investigating incidents or generating reports, CRADLE keeps everything in one secure space.


## 📜 Philosophy

In today's rapidly evolving cyber threat landscape, we recognized that existing solutions were often fragmented. We needed a platform that could address several key challenges:

- **Systematic Findings Entry:** Enable analysts to record their discoveries in an organized, methodical manner.
- **Seamless Integration:** Fit naturally into existing workflows with minimal training required.
- **Real-Time Correlation:** Allow for the instantaneous linking of insights from different analysts.
- **Robust Access Control:** Enforce strict access-control measures to ensure strong compartmentalization.
- **Accelerated Publishing:** Drastically reduce the time it takes to transition from analysis to publication.
- **Easy Integration:** Offer straightforward compatibility with external tools and APIs.

By developing our own solution, we’ve created a platform that not only meets the current demands of cyber threat intelligence but is also agile enough to evolve alongside emerging challenges. Our philosophy is rooted in empowering analysts to work smarter, faster, and more collaboratively—ultimately enhancing the overall effectiveness of threat investigations.
