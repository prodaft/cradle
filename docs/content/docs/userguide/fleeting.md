Fleeting notes are temporary drafts that auto-save as you type, allowing you to capture information quickly without immediately organizing it. These notes save automatically after one second of inactivity and remain private, visible only to you. They are marked as drafts so you can edit them until you finalize the note. Additionally, fleeting notes support file attachments just like regular notes and can be modified at any time before finalization.

To use fleeting notes, open the fleeting notes panel via the top bar, where the notes are displayed in reverse chronological order. When you want to create a new note, click on **New Note** in the sidebar and start typing, adding any necessary files along the way. You can edit or delete any note, and they will all sync across your devices. Once you review your note and decide it is ready, clicking **Save as Final** will finalize the note and add it to the knowledge graph.

Keep in mind that fleeting notes are not linked to any entities until they are finalized, and they will not appear in searches or dashboards.
