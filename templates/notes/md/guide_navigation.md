# Navigating CRADLE

In CRADLE, there are two main object types: **entries** and **notes**. CRADLE provides ways to navigate and search for both of these objects, seperately.

## Searching for Entries

Searching for entries is done via the **Search Bar** at the top of the page. When searching for entries, you can filter by either:
- **Entry Name:** By simply entering the name of the entry in the search box.
- **Entry Subtype (eg. ipv4, email, source, etc.):** By selecting the checkboxes under the filters section. Items under each other under the hierarchy are merged via `/`. Therefore, selecting the `tg` checkbox under `username` searches for entries of subtype `username/tg`.

## Searching for Notes

Searching for notes is done via the notes page. Visiting the notes page, you will be presented with two text boxes:
- **Search by content:** Search for notes by the content of the note.
- **Search by author:** Search for notes by the author of the note.

This mechanic is re-used in dashboards, so you can search for notes linked to a specific entity.
