# Fleeting Notes

Fleeting notes are temporary drafts that auto-save as you type, allowing you to
capture information quickly without immediately organizing it. These notes
automatically save after one second of inactivity and remain private, visible
only to you. They are marked as drafts, meaning you can edit them until you
finalize the note. In addition, fleeting notes support file attachments just
like regular notes and can be modified at any time before finalization.

To use fleeting notes, open the fleeting notes panel via the top bar, where the
notes are displayed in reverse chronological order. When you want to create a
new note, click on **New Note** in the sidebar and start typing, adding any
necessary files along the way. You can edit or delete any note, they will all be synced
across your devices. Once you review your note and decide it is ready, clicking
**Save as Final** will finalize the note, adding it to the knowledge graph.
Keep in mind that fleeting notes are not linked to any entities until they are
finalized, and they will not appear in searches or dashboards.
